# An infinite number of aliens take turns slicing and taking a random 
# amount of planet Earth (each subsequent alien selects a random 
# portion from what remains). Whatâ€™s the probability that the first 
# alien got the largest slice?


# Set the number of repetitions and individuals
repetitions <- 500000
individuals <- 19

# Function to simulate the slicing process
simulate_slicing <- function(individuals) {
  remaining <- 1
  slices <- numeric(individuals)
  
  for (i in 1:individuals) {
    slice <- runif(1, 0,1)
    slices[i] <- remaining * slice
    remaining <- remaining - slices[i]
  }
  
  return(slices)
}

# Run the simulation
results <- replicate(repetitions, simulate_slicing(individuals))

# Calculate the probability that the first alien got the largest slice
largest_slice_first <- sum(apply(results, 2, function(x) which.max(x) == 1)) / repetitions

# Print the result
cat("Probability that the first alien got the largest slice:", largest_slice_first, "\n")
